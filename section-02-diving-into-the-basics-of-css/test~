Improvements made on Phishing infrastructure:
- new template brand goodies
- localized james resolution page
- localized the quiz template 
- improved the french translations for the quiz template
- I could write an article that explains how any template can be localized
- created a repository for storing the templates
- create a poc for drive by smuggler with working backend and payloads for amd64 and arm
- ! low hanging fruit: change process so that custom phishings are anonymized and screenshots are added to the scenarios presentation (that Andi started)
